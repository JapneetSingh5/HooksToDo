# HooksToDo
A barebones To-Do app to help learn the basics of React Hooks.

## Useful resources to learn about React Hooks

1. Intro to React Hooks : Official Documentation <https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html>
2. Intro to the State Hook <https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html>
3. How to use React hooks - examples <https://reactgo.com/react-hooks/>
4. Build a React To-Do App with React Hooks (the article referred to while making this app) <https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-react-to-do-app-with-react-hooks-no-class-components> (Slightly tweaked by adding an option to toggle between 'Complete' and 'Incomplete' instead of just having a 'Completed' option)
